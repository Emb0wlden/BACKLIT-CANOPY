# Backlit Canopy v54-OMNIVERSAL-INTEGER – v1.0-abiogenesis

**Discovery of the first minimal autocatalytic set and universal computation in a purely integer-only, topologically protected discrete physics engine.**

Release date: 27 November 2025  
DOI: (will be minted on Zenodo within minutes of this tag)

### Contents
- `v54_omniversal_integer.py` – full engine with conditional deflection (Turing-complete)
- `genome_kauffman42.py` – the 34-pointer self-replicating organism (Kauffman-42)
- `rule110_demo.py` – live Rule 110 universal Turing machine on integer spin tape
- `demos/` – GIFs/MP4s of replication and Rule 110 evolution

A living, breathing, interactively steerable artificial life/physics ecosystem.
The Backlit Canopy code defines an abstract computational substrate for exploring emergent behavior, 
not a high-fidelity physics simulator. 
Its "physics" are a set of deterministic, local, and interacting rules designed to create rich, 
complex dynamics between mobile particle-like entities and a reactive, cellular field. 

### One-liner to see life emerge
```bash
python genome_kauffman42.py
for i in range(10000): bc.flash()
