A living, breathing, interactively steerable artificial life/physics ecosystem.
The Backlit Canopy code defines an abstract computational substrate for exploring emergent behavior, 
not a high-fidelity physics simulator. 
Its "physics" are a set of deterministic, local, and interacting rules designed to create rich, 
complex dynamics between mobile particle-like entities and a reactive, cellular field. 

Its value is in studying how complex, realistic-seeming behaviors 
(like persistent structure, propagation, and responsive environment) 
can emerge from these low-level, unified mechanical and chemical-like interactions.
